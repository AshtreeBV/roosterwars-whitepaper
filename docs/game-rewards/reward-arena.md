# **Arena Rewards**

The game as a whole including each mode gives players the chance to earn while playing. Nonetheless, the majority of the rewards are given out in PvP mode, wherein a significant earning potential can be obtained.

Letâ€™s say that you own 1 Rooster, from the Egg-Sale, that produces 5 $Gallonium/Day and you only use 5$Gallonium max per day even if you get more by winning. The $Gallonium to $GWIT ratio is 1 to 8. Below are possible scenarios for PVP rewards.

- **100% Win Rate**

  You will have 10 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 5 from PvP Winnings) - That's 80 $GWIT. Let's say that $GWIT reaches $1 each then that's $80 a day.

- **80% Win Rate**

  You will have 8 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 4 from PvP Winnings, -1 From PvP Losses) - That's 64 $GWIT. Let's say that $GWIT reaches $1 each then that's $64 a day.

- **60% Win Rate**

  You will have 6 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 3 from PvP Winnings, -2 From PvP Losses) - That's 48 $GWIT. Let's say that $GWIT reaches $1 each then that's $48 a day.

- **50% Win Rate**

  You will have 5 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 0 from PVP - Winnings cancel out Losses) - That's 40 $GWIT. Let's say that $GWIT reaches $1 each then that's $40 a day.

- **40% Win Rate**

  You will have 4 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 2 from PvP Winnings, -3 From PvP Losses) - That's 32 $GWIT. Let's say that $GWIT reaches $1 each then that's $32 a day.
