# Arena Rewards

The game, as a whole, including each mode, gives players the chance to earn while playing. Nonetheless, the majority of the rewards are given out in PvP mode, wherein significantly earning potential can be obtained. Here are some estimated situations on your potential ROI in PvP fights only.

Letâ€™s say that you own 1 Rooster, from the Egg-Sale, that produces 5 $Gallonium/Day. You then use all 5 $Gallonium and Fight in PvP.

- **100% Win Rate**

  You will have 10 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 5 from PvP Winnings) - ROI in 15 Days

- **80% Win Rate**

  You will have 8 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 4 from PvP Winnings, -1 From PvP Losses) - ROI in 19 Days (rounded up from 18.75)

- **60% Win Rate**

  You will have 6 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 3 from PvP Winnings, -2 From PvP Losses) - ROI in 25 Days

- **50% Win Rate**

  You will have 5 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 0 from PVP - Winnings cancel out Losses) - ROI in 30 Days

- **40% Win Rate**

  You will have 4 $Gallonium/Day (5 from daily, 2 from PvP Winnings, -3 From PvP Losses) - ROI in 38 Days (rounded up from 37.5)

The idea behind the PVP reward system is that players, on average, will achieve ROI within 30 days, whilst giving additional 15 days (from the 45 days) for additional earning potential.
