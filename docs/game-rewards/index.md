# **Reward System**

As we do our due diligence to optimally reward the players, the team has decided to migrate from a oracle-based reward system, to a token-based reward system. This new system **allows players to grow with the protocol** and fulfill the purpose of a community-based P2E game.

The current architecture of the reward system is being updated and will be posted here soon. We appreciate the support and patience of the community.

<!--
The rewards system will be guided by an oracle that will help sustain the stability of the game.

The current values on all calculations hereafter, along with the estimated time periods are based on the value of $GWIT at $0.02, the Initial DEX offer price.
