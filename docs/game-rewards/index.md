# **Reward System**

As we do our due diligence to optimally reward the players, the team decided to adapt a Fixed-Reward system. This new system **allows players to grow with the protocol** and fulfill the purpose of a community-based P2E game.

Fixed-Reward system means that whatever the price of $GWIT, players will receive the same amount. Let's say you receive 100 $GWIT tokens from stage 25 in the Adventure Mode, if $GWIT price moons to $10 each, you will still receive 100 $GWIT tokens that is valued at $1,000. Hence, as the price of $GWIT increases, players will earn more!

In order to keep stability of the Game Reward pool in the early days of the game, **a limit will be placed on the number of players that can play**. The limit would be the max number of **available Roosters is 150,000** (Same number of Eggs in the NFT Egg-Sale).

If all 150,000 Roosters are bought up, **new players can only enter when Breeding starts** that allows the number of Roosters to grow from 150,000.

<!--
The rewards system will be guided by an oracle that will help sustain the stability of the game.

The current values on all calculations hereafter, along with the estimated time periods are based on the value of $GWIT at $0.02, the Initial DEX offer price.
