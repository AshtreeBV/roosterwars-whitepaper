    There would be 2 kinds of $Gallonium: The Daily and the ones in the Winning vault. The Daily is refreshed every day with 5 $Gallonium, the winning vault stores all $Gallonium from PvP winnings which is not deducted in any way. Daily $Gallonium is consumed first every time, once a Rooster uses all of its daily $Gallonium, it can still fight by using $Gallonium from the vault.
