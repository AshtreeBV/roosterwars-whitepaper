# **Rewards FAQs**

1.  **What if my win rate is <50%, would I still be profitable?**

    Short Answer: **Yes**, but longer.

    Additional details to support the answer: Your Rooster has 45 Days to Produce 5 $Gallonium/day which you can use in PvP to fight more. Furthermore, even if you lose most of your fights but $GWIT price shoots up then you would still be in profit!

2.  **Is there a limit to the number of PvP fights per day?**

    Short Answer: **No**, you can fight as long as you’re winning! Battle on!

3.  **Is there a limit to the number of times I can fight in the Adventure Mode?**

    Short Answer: **No**, win or lose you can keep fighting - let the GRIND begin!

    Additional details to support the answer: However, you can only finish the Adventure mode once per Rooster, winning will move you to the next level. Finished levels cannot be repeated.

4.  **What happens to my 5 $Gallonium per day if unused?**

    Short Answer: The unused 5 $Gallonium will reset on a daily basis

    There would be 2 kinds of $Gallonium: The **Daily** $Gallonium (5 per Day) and the ones obtained from winning - **"$Gallonium Wins"**. The Daily is refreshed every day with 5 $Gallonium. "$Gallonium Wins" are stored in the rooster's vault **which is not deducted in any way\*\*.

    Daily $Gallonium is consumed first every time, once a Rooster uses all of its daily $Gallonium, it can still fight by using $Gallonium from the vault supporting the unlimited fights in question #2.

5.  **Would Training my Rooster count as $Gallonium usage?**

    Short Answer: **Yes**
    Additional details to support the answer: You still need to use all daily $Gallonium for training or PvP. The same rules apply if you don’t use daily $Gallonium, or fail to use it all up (refer to Questions 4 and 5).

6.  **Can I finish the Adventure mode without training my Rooster?**

    Short answer: **Yes**, but it would be very difficult

7.  **If I finish the Adventure Mode only, can I do it again?**

    Short answer: **No**, that would break the game econoomy by continously giving out free rewards in the adventure mode. However, the team will continuously add challenging levels as the game develops!
