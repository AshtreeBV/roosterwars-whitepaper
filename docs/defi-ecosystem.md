# DeFI Ecosystem

To achieve a stable game that will keep running in the long run, the team devised an ecosystem that will foster stable growth and development of the Rooster Wars project.

## NFT Marketplace

Rooster Wars will have its own marketplace by Q2 of 2022 (refer to Roadmap). $Rooster will be the medium of exchange where players can buy and sell all their NFTs with a 4.75% fee per transaction. The fees would be allocated to staking pools, further developing the game, filling up the reward pool, and giving back to players in multiple ways: events, airdrops, and more.&#x20;

Roosters can only be sold in the Marketplace if they have a full lifespan. This is to protect players from buying Roosters without Energy-producing capabilities.

## Staking Pool

To incentivize players holding behavior we launch a staking pool with the aim to support $Rooster price in the liquidity pool. Rewards are coming from the Farming pool where 20% of daily token releases go to the staking pool reward. Staking long term will receive above-average rewards such as:

* Staked 3 months Multiplier 1.10&#x20;
* Staked 6 months Multiplier 1.25&#x20;
* Staked 12 months Multiplier 2.00 on top of the base reward

Additionally, the Foundation may decide to allocate 10% of the NFT marketplace fee among stakers to attract more stakers and support the $ROOSTER token price.

## DEX Liquidity Pool

We launch a DEX pool for $ROOSTER token and provide initial liquidity of 30,000,000 $ROOSTER along with 600,000 BUSD taken as a portion from funds raised over the token sale.&#x20;

DEX pool works as follows: whenever someone adds a new BUSD token to the pool, that person has to add a certain amount of $ROOSTER token. The equation for working out the price of each token is

$$
x * y = k
$$

â€‹where _**x**_ is the amount of $BUSD, _**y**_ represents the amount of $ROOSTER and, _**k**_** **is constant**.**

Since the value of _**k**_ must remain the same, the cost of USDc increases while the cost of $ROOSTER in the pool decreases. So the more $ROOSTER traders put in, the less USDc the trader gets in return because its price increases.&#x20;

The size of the liquidity pool also determines how much the price of tokens will change during a trade. The more money there is in a pool, the easier it is to make larger trades without causing the price to slide as much. As initial liquidity providers, we receive 0.25% from each pool trade. We anticipate that the trading volume will be driven by several factors:

* Secondary sale of pure breeds, gems, gaffs, hens, and potions made in $ROOSTER tokens
* Marketplace Fee which is 4.75% out of transaction value
