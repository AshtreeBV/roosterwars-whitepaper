Participating in the Egg-Sale will allow users to have a pure breed NFT Rooster, a Gem, and a GAFF to be equipped to upgrade Roosters' stats. Having Gen-0 Roosters from the eggs will allow players to play the game in its first season.

The supply of Roosters will be initially limited to the Egg-Sale while the additional supply of Roosters would come from breeding upon release.
