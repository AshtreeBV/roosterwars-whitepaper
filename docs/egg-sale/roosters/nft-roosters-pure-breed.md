## **How to Buy Roosters?**

You can buy Roosters in our Egg-Sale or in the Marketplace that will be released soon after the game launches. Below are options on how to buy Roosters and be the best fighter or the best breeder, and start earning while enjoying the game.

**NFT Egg-Sale**

For the Egg-Sale, users can buy Eggs that contain a Rooster on Opensea using $USDc. After buying the Eggs, users will be able to hatch the Eggs on (Date/Time before Game launch). Egg-holders have the option to sell their Eggs after buying them.

**Marketplace**

Players who own Roosters can sell them in our Marketplace to allow new players to participate in the game. $GWIT token would be the currency used.
