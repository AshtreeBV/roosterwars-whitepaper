## **LORE**

Since the dawn of time, the Mannochs lived peacefully on one giant island of planet Galleos. Until one day, a gigantic meteor mysteriously hit the planet, plunging into the heart of the island and shattering it into fragments of smaller landmasses. From then on, the planetâ€™s inhabitants were divided into separate tribes. But little did they know that the meteor was holding the key to their future.
