## LORE

In a universe where humans do not exist, a proud race of bird-like warriors, called Roosters, rule over the _Aeviian_ kingdom on planet _Aeviis_. For centuries, peace and prosperity prospered throughout the kingdom, until chaos and conflict arose from the discovery of an ancient gate portraying tragic scenes of alien brutality towards roosters.

Internal struggle, fueled by hatred, surfaced between members of the Omni Alliance and the Feral Syndicators. A war of factions from a single race began. This is â€¦ **Rooster Wars!**
