# **Adventure Mode (PvE)**

Adventure mode is where players go on levels where theyâ€™re up against AI opponents. Players with NFT Roosters can earn rewards by clearing the levels here.

Matches in this mode will require only one Rooster (Player VS AI) where some levels require the player to defeat multiple opponents. Enemies will get stronger and the number of fights per level increases as levels progress through adventure mode. This will force the players to train their roosters to progress.

The Adventure Mode currently has **40 stages.** Rewards are given after completing every 5 stages. It is highly encouraged to train Roosters to complete levels.

More stages will be added in the future so players can earn more rewards!
