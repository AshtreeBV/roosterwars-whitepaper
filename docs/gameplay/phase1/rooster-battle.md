# **Rooster Battle**

<center>

**From the Team: This mode is currently undergoing revisions to improve players' experience and optimize earning possibilities. Thank you for your patience!**

</center>

<!--
In this mode, players are required to enter a given number of Roosters to participate. Each player will also pay a joining fee in $GWIT tokens. A prize pot from all the players joining fee is disposed of and awarded based on final ranking.

The game will take a 2.5% fee for each event, a portion of the fee will go back to the reward pool.

Scholars (_players who were given access to Roosters owned by other players_) may participate in this event using their Manager's Roosters (_players who give access_), but will have to pay the joining fee using their own $GWIT tokens.

If a scholar wins the battle, all rewards will go back to the Scholar.

## **Gameplay**

- Each player will have an equal amount of Rooster to be able to join this mode
- The game begins upon reaching the number of players required to fill up the Battle event (_Note: Number of Players, not number of Roosters_).
- Each Rooster will have one fight only
- A **win** will give the player **+ 1**, a **draw** gives out **+ 0.5** to both players, and a **loss** will be **zero**
- Player/s with the highest total points (_most wins_) at the end will be declared as Champion/s
- Champion/s will be rewarded with the majority of the joining fee, in $GWIT tokens, collected earlier
- Other players will take home a consolation prize in $GWIT tokens as well
- Fights will be simulated and no one can dictate what moves the Roosters will use
