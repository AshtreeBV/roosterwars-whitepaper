# Gameplay

### Combat Mechanics

* Rooster Wars’ combat will be a fast-paced rock paper scissors game.
* Matches will have a wait phase where players must choose which moves they’ll pick. Once the meter at the top is gone, both roosters will use the move. (Roosters who didn’t choose a move will do nothing in that turn and will take damage).&#x20;
* Roosters will have three attacks using their beak, wings, and claws which represent rock paper scissors&#x20;
* If players throw the same move they’ll both inflict damage to each other but only take 50% damage to each other.&#x20;
* Players can watch matches again at the results screen.&#x20;
* Matches will be fast-paced and players will have to choose between moves quickly.
