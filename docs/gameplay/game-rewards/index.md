<!--
As we do our due diligence to optimally reward the players, the team decided to adapt a Fixed-Reward system. This new system **allows players to grow with the protocol** and fulfill the purpose of a community-based P2E game.

Fixed-Reward system means that whatever the price of the Token is in the MArket, players will receive the same amount. Let's say you receive 100 the Tokens from stage 25 in the Adventure Mode, if the Token price moons to $10 each, you will still receive 100 the Tokens that is valued at $1,000. Hence, as the price of the Token increases, players will earn more!

In order to keep stability of the Game Reward pool in the early days of the game, **a limit will be placed on the number of players that can play**. The limit would be the max number of **available Roosters is 150,000** (Same number of Eggs in the NFT Egg-Sale).

If all 150,000 Roosters are bought up, **new players can only enter when Breeding starts** allowing the number of Roosters to grow from 150,000.
