# **Reward System**

As we do our due diligence to optimally reward the players, the team decided to adapt a Fixed-Reward system. This new system **allows players to grow with the protocol** and fulfill the purpose of a community-based P2E game.

Fixed-Reward system means that whatever the price of $GWIT is in the MArket, players will receive the same amount. Let's say you receive 100 $GWIT tokens from stage 25 in the Adventure Mode, if $GWIT price moons to $10 each, you will still receive 100 $GWIT tokens that is valued at $1,000. Hence, as the price of $GWIT increases, players will earn more!

In order to keep stability of the Game Reward pool in the early days of the game, **a limit will be placed on the number of players that can play**. The limit would be the max number of **available Roosters is 150,000** (Same number of Eggs in the NFT Egg-Sale).

If all 150,000 Roosters are bought up, **new players can only enter when Breeding starts** allowing the number of Roosters to grow from 150,000.
