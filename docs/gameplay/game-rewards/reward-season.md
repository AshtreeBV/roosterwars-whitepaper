# **Season Rewards**

Season rewards are given out every 2 months and are given out into two classes: Challenger Tier rewards and Top 10 player rewards. Rewards will be given on a per-player/account basis.

_For full details regarding the gameplay, head on over to [Arena (PVP)](../phase1/arena/index.md#chicken-points---challenger-tier) game mode._

The amount of rewards given out depends on the number of active Roosters playing the game which is 100 $GWIT per active Rooster in-game.

**More Roosters = More Rewards**

</center>

For simplicity, the values calculated for the Season Rewards are based on the max number of Roosters in the game, 150,000 Roosters, before Breeding starts.

<center><small>The actual $GWIT price will be dictated by market movements, **Higher price = Higher Rewards**</small></center>

## **Challenger Tier Rewards**

The amount of rewards given out depends on the number of active Roosters playing the game which is 90 $GWIT per active Rooster in-game.

Giving rewards in this section is a little tricky, therefore we will place certain conditions to prevent unfair distribution.

<center>

A possible Situation of Unfair Distribution

<small>_If the number of players with CP below 150 is 10, while the number of players with CP above 1000 is 100. Then each player below 150 CP will get 0.7% while the players with CP above 1,000 will get 0.16% each._</small>

Solution to avoid Unfair Distribution

<small>_To avoid such a situation, we will follow the CP system along with a **100-player batch for each range**. If a certain range has less than 100 players, rewards will still be based on the 4th column below. However, if more than 100 players are in a certain batch, we will reallocate rewards from other batches with less than 100 players._</small>
