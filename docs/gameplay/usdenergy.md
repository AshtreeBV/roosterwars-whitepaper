# $Energy

$Energy is an in-game only token that can be swapped for $Rooster Token (not vice-versa: this would be P2W)

### $Energy System

* The Ratio of $Energy to $Rooster would be dependent on the number of Roosters in-game and the Price movements of $Rooster Token (Supply-Demand).&#x20;
* The Ratio is transparent and cannot be changed by any of the team members: the conversion formula is in the Smart Contract.&#x20;
* NFT Roosters Generate 5 $Energy/Day&#x20;
* $Energy is per rooster basis and non-transferable to other Roosters&#x20;
* $Energy is consumed in PVP and Training Roosters&#x20;
* Every end-of-the-week, $Energy can be converted to $Rooster without any fees.&#x20;
* Players are allowed to convert earlier but with a 20% Fee (fee is not reduced daily)
