# **AMATEUR "BACKYARD" NFT ROOSTERS (THE STAGS)**

Stags are basic breed of roosters with randomized fighting attributes. Gaming stats will be stored in the blockchain but should be earned by the NFT player to enhance the potential value of that particular NFT. The more NFTs are played, the better stats achieved, then the higher the potential value of the NFTs. These Amateur NFTs can be exchanged to Professional NFTs on a 10:1 ratio creating a natural burning mechanism thereby setting up a synthetic scarcity on the Amateur NFTs.

Once an Amateur NFT graduates to a Professional NFT, the economic environment expands naturally.
