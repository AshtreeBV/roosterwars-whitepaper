# **Professional NFT Roosters**

Each Rooster has a different set of stats which will make them unique from each other.

Amateur NFT Roosters only have a base stat total of 150, while Professional NFT Roosters have a base stat total of 196. These stat totals are then divided into each of their stats:

1. Vitality (VIT/HP)
2. Wing Attack (WATK)
3. Beak Attack (BATK)
4. Claw Attack (CATK)
5. Dodge Chance (SPD)
6. Critical Chance (AGRO)

Players can raise their stats by training (future) and gaff & gem equipment (future).

Details on Professional NFT Rooster Stats

- Damage = ATK/4
- Dodge and Crit Chance are percentage-based, their percentage will differ from breeds.
- If the rooster is equipped with a gallus gem that has +5 damage: Damage + 5
- Critical Damage = Damagex2
- Draw Damage = Damage/2

## **How to Buy Roosters?**

You can purchase your NFT Roosters in our <a href="https://www.pecado.io">PECADO NFT engine.</a>

## **COMBAT MECHANISM**

- Rooster Wars’ combat will be a fast-paced “Rock-Paper-Scissors” game.
- Matches will have a “wait phase” where players must choose which moves to pick. Once the meter wanes down, both players will have to pick a combat move. (Players who failed to choose a combat move on that sequence will incur damage to their NFT).
- Roosters will have three combat moves, the beak (representing rock), wings (representing paper), and claws (representing scissors).
- If both players deploy the same combat move, they will both inflict damage to their NFTs, but its effect will only take 50% damage to each other.
- Players will have the opportunity to replay the previous match.

## **QBUX AS A STAKING POOL UTILITY TOKEN**

Within the ANTx ecosystem, the QBUX utility token mainly functions as a staking pool currency. This type of token has no smart contract but is directly derived from the staked GALLO Security Token. To exit, the QBUX token has to convert back into GALLO Security Token.

## **ENSURING THE AUTHENTICITY OF ROOSTER WARS' NFTs**

To ensure the authenticity of Rooster Wars’ NFTs, we recommend trading within the PECADO NFT engine. Though external trades are doable (i.e., Metamask, Trust Wallet, etc.), Fowl Play Inc. cannot guarantee the authenticity of the assets traded outside. An authentic Rooster Wars NFT can easily be played in the gaming modes, while the non-authentic NFTs will be incompatible to the system.
