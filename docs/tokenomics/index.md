## **Circular Economy**

<img src="../images/Circular-economy.png" alt="Economy" class="economy-banner">
</center>

$GWIT token is built on a circular economic model with a limited token supply.

The reward pools (Gaming and Farming) will be filled up using the subscription method of the gameplay that allows $GWIT to circulate in a healthy manner. Fees from Marketplace transactions will also play a role in filling up the reward pools.

Also a sell tax is part of the GWIT smart contract that takes a percentage (%) of selling volume that goes to reward pools.
