## **Circular Economy**

<img src="../images/Circular-economy.png" alt="Economy" class="economy-banner">
</center>

$GWIT token is built on a circular economic model with a limited token supply, accompanied by a burning mechanism. 

The Gaming reward pool will be filled up using the subscription method of the gameplay that allows $GWIT to circulate in a healthy manner. Fees from Marketplace transactions will also play a role in filling up the reward pool. 

Also, a sell-tax is part of the GWIT smart contract that takes a percentage (%) of selling volume that goes to reward pools.

<center>

## **Supply & Demand Control**

</center>

Rooster Wars focuses on $GWIT “sinks” accompanied by burning the token supply. The inflation rate of $GWIT considers the growth of the protocol and is designed to support the needs of the players within the game. 

Sinks are players/agents' ways to spend $GWIT in the economy. A percentage of $GWIT that is spent is used to refill the Gaming Reward pool which then continues to reward players, as shown in the previous illustration. 

The Burning mechanism comes from a percentage of player spending of $GWIT inside the protocol. The Utility section shows the ways for players/agents to earn and/or spend $GWIT in the RW economy. 


<center>

## **Utility**

</center>

The $GWIT token functions as the main utility token for the Rooster Wars game and ecosystem.

Here are examples of the $GWIT token's utilities in the Rooster Wars ecosystem

1.  Breeding: Payment for breeding fees _(future)_
2.  Land Acquisition _(future)_
3.  NFT Marketplace: Buy & Sell Roosters, Hens, GAFFs, Gems, and more.
4.  Buying Gilly Juice
5.  Farming / Staking: Earn Rewards
6.  Participate in other Game Mode Rewards:
    1. PVP (Charged Gallonium to $GWIT)
    2. PVP (Season Rewards)
    3. Adventure Rewards
    4. Team Battle Rewards
