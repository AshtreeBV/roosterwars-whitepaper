# **Farming $GWIT**

Liquidity providers have an option to generate additional rewards on top of the swap fee by allocating LP tokens to yield farming. For this purpose, the Foundation allocates 80% of the daily $GWIT release from Farming pools to liquidity providers based on their respective share in total liquidity. In order to participate in the farming LPs would need to stake their LP tokens. Early LPs would benefit from higher rewards.
