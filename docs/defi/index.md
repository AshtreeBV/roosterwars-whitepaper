# DeFI Ecosystem

To achieve a stable game that will keep running in the long run, the team devised an ecosystem that will foster stable growth and development of the Rooster Wars project.

## NFT Marketplace

Rooster Wars will have its own marketplace by Q2 of 2022 (refer to Roadmap). $GWIT will be the medium of exchange where players can buy and sell all their NFTs with a 4.75% fee per transaction. The fees would be allocated to staking pools, further developing the game, filling up the reward pool, and giving back to players in multiple ways: events, airdrops, and more.

Roosters can only be sold in the Marketplace if they have a full lifespan. This is to protect players from buying Roosters without $Gallonium-producing capabilities.

## $GWIT Staking Pool

To incentivize players holding behavior we will launch a staking pool with the aim to support $GWIT price in the liquidity pool. Rewards will be coming from the Farming pool where 20% of daily token releases go to the staking pool reward. Staking long term will receive above-average rewards such as:

- Staked 3 months Multiplier 1.10
- Staked 6 months Multiplier 1.25
- Staked 12 months Multiplier 2.00 on top of the base reward

Additionally, the Foundation may decide to allocate 10% of the NFT marketplace fee among stakers to attract more stakers and support the $GWIT token price.

## $GWIT DEX Liquidity Pool

We launch a DEX pool for $GWIT token and provide initial liquidity of 30,000,000 $GWIT along with 600,000 BUSD taken as a portion from funds raised over the token sale.

DEX pool works as follows: whenever someone adds a new BUSD token to the pool, that person has to add a certain amount of $GWIT token. The equation for working out the price of each token is

$$
x * y = k
$$

â€‹where _**x**_ is the amount of $BUSD, _**y**_ represents the amount of $GWIT and, _**k**_ is constant.

Since the value of _**k**_ must remain the same, the cost of USDc increases while the cost of $GWIT in the pool decreases. So the more $GWIT traders put in, the less USDc the trader gets in return because its price increases.

The size of the liquidity pool also determines how much the price of tokens will change during a trade. The more money there is in a pool, the easier it is to make larger trades without causing the price to slide as much. As initial liquidity providers, we receive 0.25% from each pool trade. We anticipate that the trading volume will be driven by several factors:

- Secondary sale of pure breeds, gems, GAFFs, hens, and potions made in $GWIT tokens
- Marketplace Fee which is 4.75% out of transaction value
