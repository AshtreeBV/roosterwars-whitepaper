# **Arena (PvP)**

### **Arena Mechanics**

- Players must have at least one NFT Rooster to enter.
- Players can use their NFT Rooster here and take on other players.
- Roosters can fight as long as they have $Gallonium
- Arena mode will feature a ranking system. This will determine the matchmaking to ensure fair-play matches with a Rooster in the same tier, as well as the basis for giving out additional rewards.
- Players can only fight if equal amounts of $Gallonium are used (e.g. both used 1 $Gallonium)
- Depending on its respective tier, the winner will be rewarded with Stars or Chicken Points (CP), and $Gallonium based on the amount of $Gallonium used in a fight, with **[Diminishing Returns](diminishing-returns.md)** upon winning n-times.
- Winning a match regains the $Gallonium consumed to fight
- The number of wins is refreshed daily

## **Stars and Chicken Points (CP)**

Rooster Wars will use a Tier system inspired by popular games like League of Legends (LoL), Mobile Legends (MLBB), and Call of Duty (CoD) to ensure players have fair matchmaking and a fun and challenging ranking system.

Rewards will be given to the top 10 Players every season and to those who qualify in the Challenger Tier. One season lasts for 2 months.

### **Tier System (Stars)**

- Winning a fight will give you a Star - Losing will take one from you
- Players need 5 Stars to rank up - Promoted to next Tier or Division
- Losing when you have no stars will get you demoted to the previous Tier or Division with 4 Stars
- Winning 3 or 5 $Gallonium fights will give you 3 or 5 stars, respectively
- Losing 3 or 5 $Gallonium fights will take 3 or 5 stars from you, respectively
