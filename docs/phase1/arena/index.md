# **Arena (PvP)**

In this mode, players have two (2) options to decide from before fighting:

- Use 1 $Gallonium
- Use 0 $Gallonium - **Unlimited Fights!**

The first option allows players to simultaneously increase their $Gallonium holdings and Rank/Tier upon every win. The latter allows players to grind and battle as long as they want to climb up to the _Challenger tier_ and have a share in the Seasonal Rewards.

### **Arena Mechanics**

- Players must have at least one NFT Rooster to enter.
- Players can use their NFT Rooster here and take on other players.
- Arena mode will feature a ranking system. This will determine the matchmaking to ensure fair-play matches with a Rooster in the same tier, as well as the basis for giving out additional rewards.
- Players can only fight if equal amounts of $Gallonium are used (e.g. both used 1 $Gallonium)
- Depending on its respective tier, the winner will be rewarded with Stars or Chicken Points (CP), and $Gallonium based on the amount of $Gallonium used in a fight.

## **Stars and Chicken Points (CP)**

Rooster Wars will use a Tier system inspired by popular games like League of Legends (LoL), Mobile Legends (MLBB), and Call of Duty (CoD) to ensure players have fair matchmaking and a fun and challenging ranking system.

Rewards will be given to the top 10 Players every season and to those who qualify in the Challenger Tier. One season lasts for 2 months.

### **Tier System (Stars)**

- Winning a fight will give you a Star - Losing will take one from you
- Players need 5 Stars to rank up - Promoted to next Tier or Division
- Losing when you have no stars will get you demoted to the previous Tier or Division with 4 Stars

Below is a sample for Tiers and Ranks, but the number of Ranks and Tiers is positively related to the number of active players in the Arena (PvP).
