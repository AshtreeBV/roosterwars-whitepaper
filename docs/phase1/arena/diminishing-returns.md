# Diminishing Returns

The concept of Diminishing Returns is placed to disincentivize unlimited fights. This will help maintain balance among players.

Using 3, and 5 $Gallonium per fight will increase all rewards earned by 3x, and 5x, respectively.

Below is the Diminishing Returns table wherein results are based on a WIN. Rewards are an additional $Gallonium gained from Winning. **The $Gallonium spent is also returned to the Winner**.

| **$Gallonium Used/Fight** | **1st Win** | **2nd Win** | **3rd Win** | **4th Win** | **5th Win** | **Nth Win** | **Total Winnings** |
| ------------------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :----------------: |
| **1 $Gallonium**          |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |       **+5**       |
| **3 $Gallonium**          |      3      |      2      |      2      |      0      |      0      |      0      |       **+7**       |
| **5 $Gallonium**          |      5      |      3      |      2      |      0      |      0      |      0      |      **+10**       |

The numbers 1, 3, and 5 are fixed options of $Gallonium consumption that the player chooses before battling, given that the Rooster has enough $Gallonium to fight.

If a player decides to choose different $Gallonium consumption per fight (e.g 1st-1 $Gallonium, 2nd-5 $Gallonium, 3rd-1 $Gallonium, 4th-3 $Gallonium) then rewards will be based on the previous number of wins for a given option.

Below are situations of player fights with different $Gallonium consumed every fight

**Situation 1**

1. 1st Fight - Player used 1 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 1 Gallonium
2. 2nd Fight - Player used 5 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 3 Gallonium, since the total wins (TW) would be 6 and classified as a 2nd Win under the 5-$Gallonium option

**Situation 2**

1. 1st Fight - Player used 1 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 1 Gallonium
2. 2nd Fight - Player used 3 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 2 Gallonium, TW: 4, falls under 2nd Win in the 3-Gallonium option
3. 3rd Fight - Player used 1 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 1 Gallonium, TW: 5, falls under 5th win
4. 4th Fight - Player used 1 Gallonium - Wins: Reward is 0 Gallonium, TW: 6, falls under nth win
