# Diminishing Returns

The concept of Diminishing Returns is placed to disincentivize unlimited fights. This will help maintain balance among players.

Using 3, and 5 $Energy per fight will increase all rewards earned by 3x, and 5x, respectively.

Below is the Diminishing Returns table wherein results are based on a WIN. Rewards are additional $Energy gained from Winning. **The $Energy spent is also returned to the Winner**.

| **Energy Used/Fight** | **1st Win** | **2nd Win** | **3rd Win** | **4th Win** | **5th Win** | **Nth Win** | **Total Winnings** |
| --------------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :----------------: |
| **1 Energy**          |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |      1      |       **+5**       |
| **3 Energy**          |      3      |      2      |      2      |      0      |      0      |      0      |       **+7**       |
| **5 Energy**          |      5      |      3      |      2      |      0      |      0      |      0      |      **+10**       |

The numbers 1, 3, and 5 are fixed options of energy consumption that the player chooses before battling, given that the Rooster has enough energy to fight.

If a player decides to choose different energy consumption per fight (e.g 1st-1 energy, 2nd-5 energy, 3rd-1 energy, 4th-3 energy) then rewards will be based on the previous number of wins for a given option.&#x20;

Below are situations of player fights with different energy consumed every fight

**Situation 1**

1. 1st Fight - Player used 1 Energy - Wins: Reward is 1 Energy
2. 2nd Fight - Player used 5 Energy - Wins: Reward is 3 Energy (since the total wins (TW) would be 6 and classified as a 2nd Win under the 5-energy option)

**Situation 2**

1. 1st Fight - Player used 1 Energy - Wins: Reward is 1 Energy
2. 2nd Fight - Player used 3 Energy - Wins: Reward is 2 Energy (TW: 4, falls under 2nd Win in the 3-energy option)
3. 3rd Fight - Player used 1 Energy - Wins: Reward is 1 Energy (TW: 5, falls under 5th win)
4. 4th Fight - Player used 1 Energy - Wins: Reward is 0 Energy (TW: 6, falls under nth win)

**Situation 3**

1. 1st Fight - Player used 5 Energy - Wins: Reward is 5 Energy
2. 2nd Fight - Player used 1 Energy - Wins: Reward is 0 Energy (player now has 6 wins and falls under nth win of 1-energy fights)
