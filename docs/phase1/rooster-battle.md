# **Rooster Battle**

In this mode, players are required to enter a given number of Roosters to participate. Each player will also pay a joining fee in $GWIT tokens. A prize pot from all the players joining fee is disposed of and awarded based on final ranking.

The game will take a 2.5% fee for each event, a portion of the fee will go back to the reward pool.

Scholars (_players who were given access to Roosters owned by other players_) may participate in this event using their Manager's Roosters (_players who give access_), but will have to pay the joining fee using their own $GWIT tokens.

If a scholar wins the battle, all rewards will go back to the Scholar.

## **Gameplay**

- Each player will have an equal amount of Rooster to be able to join this mode.
- The game begins upon reaching the number of players required to fill up the Battle event (_Note: Number of Players, not number of Roosters_).
- Each Rooster will have one fight only.
- A win will give the player +1, while a loss will be zero
- Player/s with the highest total points (_most wins_) at the end will be declared as Champion/s
- Champion/s will be rewarded with the majority of the joining fee, in $GWIT tokens, collected earlier
- Other players will take home a consolation prize in $GWIT tokens as well
- Fights will be simulated and no one can dictate what moves the Roosters will use.
