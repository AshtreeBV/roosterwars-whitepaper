# **Stablecoin Earnings**

Rooster Wars' earning mechanism will be on stable coins as an interim for the players’ earning potential and a permanent feature that will be released prior to $GWIT’s TGE. The goal is to enable a relatively risk-off or stable earning mechanism for players compared to $GWIT earnings given the current bearish market sentiment, to preserve the value of $GWIT while allowing players to start earning.

## **Pre-TGE for $GWIT**

Prior to $GWIT’s release (TGE), Rooster Wars will release its Play-and-Earn mechanism using a stablecoin (USDC/USDT) in the Arena (PvP) mode that will be the first game feature to be released that will have multiple reward avenues for players:

- Direct Rewards from PvP fights
- Tournaments
- Season Rewards

### **Direct Rewards**

Direct Rewards refer to the earnings you get immediately after winning a fight in the Arena. 

<!--
It will be in “QBUX” wherein players will purchase “QBUX” using USDC, and use that to play in the Arena.
"QBUX" is an external backend token that can be used within the Rooster Wars ecosystem, and other ecosystems from future projects and partners related to Rooster Wars.
-->

For details on the gameplay, the matches will follow the [Arena](../gameplay/phase1/arena/index.md) setup. The concept of Tiers, Stars and Chicken Points will come at a later date.


#### **W2E: Win-to-Earn**

For direct rewards, only the winner gets rewarded and the loser loses his/her stake. So a breakeven for earnings would be at a 50% win rate. RW’s team will introduce fees so the players’ ROI will only be achieved by win rates above 50%.

<!--
In the beginning, players are to “bet” 1 “QBUX” per match. In future updates, the RW team is looking to support 2 to N “QBUX” per match and concepts of “Sado”.
-->

#### **How Fees are Charged**

<!-- 2 Fees
There are two (2) fees charged for the “Direct Rewards”:

1. **Fight Fees** (5%)
2. **Withdrawal Fees** (5%)
-->

The majority of the “Fight Fees” will be distributed as profit to the NFT owners of a specific fight, a portion will be labeled as Rooster Wars’ revenue, and the rest will be used for tournament prizes, and special events.

- NFT Owners
       - NFT Owner 1 - 40%
       - NFT Owner 2 - 40%
- RW Revenue - 14%
- Tournaments & Season Rewards - 6%

Yes, we are **redistributing revenues to NFT owners** of that specific fight. This will drive more value to our NFTs, and will help generate demand from the current and future community.

<!-- Withdrawal Fees
The “Withdrawal Fees” will be used for the continuous development of the Rooster Wars project, operating expenses, capital expenses, marketing and user acquisition, team expansion, and others including team’s revenue. The fee is charged when players convert their “QBUX” to USDC or any other stable coin that the project supports.
-->

### **Tournaments!**

Stay tuned for Tournament announcements and get a chance to participate and win rewards!

### **Season Rewards**

A reward avenue that rewards top players during On-Season and provides a preparation period which is labeled as Off-Season.

Pre-TGE, this feature would reward players in $USDC, upon the release of $GWIT, $GWIT rewards will be added here and only Active Roosters are entitled to this feature
